     <h2>Random thoughts in my Head</h2>

     <p>Sometimes I wonder, will this blog ever get read? Because, if so then the time that I took writing it would have paid off, other wise what a waste. It is so hard to come up with ideas yet still here I am, providing you with my best. Well I would be my best if you stopped reading now as the following sentences will be randomly generated text. Now if you made it this far in reading congratulations and here is your reward. He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day, he added something new. This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demurring and saying that would be all. It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years.</p>
     <p>Round of applause to you if you skipped the first paragraph and didn’t waste your energy and time. But in this paragraph, we have the bonus round of randomly generated paragraphs, basically nothing has changed. The trees, therefore, must be such old and primitive techniques that they thought nothing of them, deeming them so inconsequential that even savages like us would know of them and not be suspicious. At that, they probably didn't have too much time after they detected us orbiting and intending to land. And if that were true, there could be only one place where their civilization was hidden.</p>

      <h2>My thoughts keep getting worse</h2>

      <p>It has been one day since I last updated you on my random thoughts. Today’s blog wont be as random, but just me talking to you about the process of getting this blog up and running. It started with my lab document outlining all the components that I would need to create my webpage for this blog. It was simple enough in the beginning but like everything in life it grew increasingly difficult. This led me to watch countless hours of youtube which only helped me to spin faster in circles. It wasn’t until I got assistance that I figured out what was expected of me.</p>
      <p>Even though the instructions were clearly stated in the lab, there were some omissions of vital information that played with my sanity. And to be completely honest I would not have been able to complete the lab without assistance. But here we are with a finished product that hopefully meets all criteria.</p>
